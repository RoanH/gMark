# gMark
gMark is a domain- and query language-independent graph instance and query workload generator. The original version of gMark is available on GitHub at [gbagan/gmark](https://github.com/gbagan/gmark). The version of gMark in this repository has as goal to rewrite gMark such that it is easier to extend and has better documented code. Initially the focus of the rewrite is on query generation, but the end goal is full feature parity with the original version of gMark. Currently the write is not at that point yet and is notably still missing graph generation, RPQ (regular path query) based queries and several output formats. The current does however also offer some features not present in the original version of gMark, such as the ability to generate CPQ (conjunctive path query) based queries and a graphical user interface for the program.
